# py_jama_client

A python Jama Connect REST API client library

## Acknowledgments

This client library is heavily inspired by, and even based on the client library created by the Jama team at [https://github.com/jamasoftware-ps/py-jama-rest-client]. However, due to inactivity I have taken it upon myself to create a distinct package for those who have a need for a more comprehensive client -- specifically for the use of embedded resources.
